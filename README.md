# AlbatrossServer
Albatross Server is the core component of the Albatross dynamic instrumentation tool. It enables Albatross not only to be packaged into an app but also to be dynamically injected. It is responsible for running Albatross plugins on the target device, achieving real-time instrumentation, code modification, and monitoring of the target application.
